# PhonePervasiveness
Project repo for Data Science course "Social Dynamics", where I get to study the relationship of phone pervasiveness. 
The data comprehends social phenomena, such as identity and activities of about 200 users, and their phone usage sensors. In this repository I work with touchscreen sensor data. The goal is to match the sensor data and specific locations where the user was, in order to map the phone pervasiveness in users' lives and activities. 

Data comes from "WeNet" project; the section of data I work on was collected in November 2020 in Trento with students' phones. It will not be provided for various reasons. It was provided by my University for curricular activities.
